* Reaper-Keys
Reaper-Keys is an extension for the [[https://www.reaper.fm/][REAPER DAW]], that provides a new action
mapping system based on key sequences instead of key chords. The system is 
similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%2528text_editor%2529][Vim]], a modal text editor, and by default comes with vim-like bindings. 



** Pros
- Saving a couple minutes per hour
- Developing arthritis at 60 instead of 40
- Reduced mouse usage
- A more fluid experience
- Quick access to many key bindings
** Features
*** Bind key sequences
With reaper-keys, you may bind key sequences to actions, rather then singular
key presses. This allows one to make use of mnemonics, such as 't' for track,
or 'a' for arming.

A completion/feedback window is provided to assist with command completion. Here
is an example of navigating through the menu to render a project.

*** Compose actions
Reaper-keys  lets one compose actions of different types to create new commands.
For example, any ~timeline motion~  action can follow any  ~timeline operator~
action, and any ~number~ can prefix a ~timeline motion~.

If one enters ~c2L~ it would compose into ~(c = "Change", 2, L = "NextMeasure")~,
and trigger a command to set up a record loop and record over the next 2 measures.

To select the items in the next 2  measures, one could enter ~s2L~.

This grows the number of available actions exponentially but still preserves your
brain, as you only need to know the ~timeline_motions~, ~timeline_operators~, and
the fact that you can compose them. 

*** Multi-modal
Changing modes changes the way keys compose. By default, it is in ~normal~ mode, but you could for example go into ~visual timeline~ mode by pressing ~v~.

In this mode, ~timeline motions~ extend the current time selection, and ~timeline
actions~ operate immediately and return one to ~normal~ mode. Useful if you want
visual feedback before executing a timeline action, or just want to extend the
time selection using motion commands.

*** Macros
Macros are a way to save a sequence of commands, and play them back later.

To record a macro, enter ~q~ and an arbitrary character to specify the ~register~ that
the macro will save into. Then, perform a series of actions, and finish
recording by pressing ~q~.

You may play it back by entering ~@~ and the character you specified earlier.
Optionally, prefix it with a number to indicate the number of repetitions.

Here is an example of recording and playing a macro that deletes item parts across
two tracks in a ribbon style.

** Installation
- Clone this repository or download it via the 'releases' tab.
- Put this repository into your  ~REAPER/Scripts~  directory . If you're unsure where your ~REAPER~ directory is, just run the action 'Show REAPER resource path in explorer' in REAPER.
- Back up your key map by exporting it, then import the provided keymap ~reaper-keys.ReaperKeyMap~ via the ~import~ button at the bottom of the action list window in Reaper. (This will overwrite your current key bindings!)
- For all the actions to work, install the [[https://sws-extension.org/][SWS/S&M]]  extension for Reaper .
** Help
Enter ~<SPC>h~ to print a list of available bindings, their action types, as well as the available
action sequences for the current context and mode.

** Configuration
All you need to configure reaper-keys is under the [[file:definitions/]] directory.  
Take a look at the [[file:definitions/README.org]] file for more details.
