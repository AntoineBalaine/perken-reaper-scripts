#+begin_src lua
local default_cmd_example = {
  cmd = 65535, -- an item or array of cmd id's and/or cmd name's and/or Vimper cmds, to execute in sequence
  name = "No-op (no action)", -- the name to be shown in hint window, defaults to desc. of 1st cmd
  times = 1, -- number of times to run cmd
  prenum = true, -- interpret prefixed number as # repetitions
  postnum = false, -- interpret post-fixed number as selector (e.g. mute for track n)
}

  Special keys:
  <space>
  <ctrl>
  <alt>
  <mod> (windows key)

To add new bindable keys you need to create a new script in ~mapper_scripts~, and map it to a key in reaper. Most people should not need to do this, and I will work towards having as many keys mappable as possible.
Alternatively, you can add a new entry in ~gen_mapper_scripts.sh~, run it, and re-import the keymap, but this requires bash.
