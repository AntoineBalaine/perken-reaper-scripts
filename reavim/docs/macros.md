# Macros

A macro is a sequence of actions one may record and execute later.

Start recording a macro with <kbd>q</kbd> and pressing an arbitrary key to indicate the 'register' the macro will be stored into.

Once some actions have been recorded, finish recording by pressing <kbd>q</kbd>

Play back the macro later by pressing <kbd>@</kbd> and the register the macro was stored into.

You may also prefix <kbd>@</kbd> with a number to indicate the number of repetitions.
