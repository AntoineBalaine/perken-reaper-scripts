# Modes

Reaper-keys has multiple modes. Depending on the mode one is in, the available action sequences (thus the available key bindings) may change. The behaviour of action sequences may change as well.

The action sequence(s) available for all modes are:

| Action Sequence | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `command` | Just executes the action |
