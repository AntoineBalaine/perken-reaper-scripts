# LIP - Lua INI Parser
*Lua INI Parser* is a tiny Lua library allowing to handle *.ini* files.

# Usage
Add [LIP.lua](https://github.com/Dynodzzo/Lua_INI_Parser/blob/master/LIP.lua) file into your project folder.<br />
Call it using __require__ function.<br />
It will return a table containing read & write functions.

# Full overview
* __LIP.load(fileName)__ : Returns a table containing all the values from the file.
* __LIP.save(fileName, data)__ : Saves the data into the specified file.

# Examples
Here's how to save some data :

```lua
local LIP = require 'LIP';

local data =
{
	sound =
	{
		left = 70,
		right = 80,
	},
	screen =
	{
		width = 960,
		height = 544,
		caption = 'Window\'s caption',
		focused = true,
	},
};

-- Data saving
LIP.save('savedata.ini', data);
````
And the *.ini* file created :
```ini
[sound]
left=70
right=80

[screen]
width=960
height=544
caption=Window's caption
focused=true
````

Now let's get all this data :

```lua
local LIP = require 'LIP';

-- Data loading
local data = LIP.load('savedata.ini');

print(data.sound.right); --> 80
print(data.screen.caption); --> Window's caption
print(data.screen.focused); --> true
````

It is also possible to give indexes instead of keys :

```lua
local data =
{
	{
		right = 40,
		50,
	},
	{
		'Some text',
		20,
		true,
	},
};
````

And we have to retrieve data using these indexes :

```lua
print(data[1][1]); --> 50
print(data[1].right) --> 40
print(data[2][1]); --> Some text
print(data[2][3]); --> true
````
